Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to assemble Citibike of NY's data to compile a plan to gain support for investors to financially support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. We created a series of visualizations to demonstrate the feasability and some key considerations to move forward with the project.

## Results

The results of the analysis and visualizations are shown below:

## Summary

From the analysis we performed we can reasonably determine that many customers of NY Citibike are men that subscribe to Citibike's service that use the bikes to commute to and from work. Although that is the primary customer that we would target in Des Moines, Iowa; there may be a number of distinctions to be made about the feasibility and potential success of starting this bike service in Iowa. NYC is highly congested and many of the destinations are relatively close together. The data suggests that most of the time these last only 5 minutes from start to destination. Iowa may be a different use case altogether as although it is a populous city, it is arguably more spread out in terms of business locations. This may compound the problem of storage locations for Citibike. There are oppotunities to implement this service in Des Moines but we recommend soliciting potential customers feedback before proceeding to see if there is enough support to invest in moving forward with the project and also adding 2 additional visualizations to this analysis; Number of businesses in Des Moines and their relative distance to one another, and population of Des Moines and surrounding suburbs.
